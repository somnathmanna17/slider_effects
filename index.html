                    <div class="description">The moose (Alces alces) is the largest member of the deer family, found in
                        northern forests across North America, Europe, and Asia. Known for their long legs and large,
                        flat antlers (on males), moose can weigh up to 1,600 pounds. They are herbivores, feeding on
                        leaves, bark, and aquatic plants, and are strong swimmers that often wade into water for food.

                        Moose are typically solitary and well-suited to cold climates, with thick fur and limbs built
                        for deep snow. Despite their calm appearance, they can be aggressive when threatened, especially
                        mothers with calves. They rely more on smell and hearing than sight and have few natural
                        predators aside from wolves and bears. Human activity and vehicle collisions are major threats
                        to their survival.</div>

                    <div class="title">ELEPHANT</div>
                    <div class="description">Elephants are the largest land animals, with three species: African
                        savanna, African forest, and Asian elephants. Known for their trunks, large ears, and tusks (in
                        most males), they use their trunks for breathing, eating, drinking, and communication. African
                        elephants have larger ears, while Asian elephants are smaller with rounded ears.

                        Highly intelligent and social, elephants live in matriarchal herds and display emotions like
                        joy, grief, and empathy. They communicate through sounds, touch, and ground vibrations.
                        Herbivores by nature, they eat grasses, bark, fruit, and roots, consuming large amounts daily.

                        Elephants are vital to their ecosystems, helping shape landscapes and spread plant seeds.
                        Despite their importance, they face major threats from habitat loss, human conflict, and
                        poaching for ivory. Both African and Asian elephants are endangered, with conservation efforts
                        focused on protecting their habitats and stopping illegal trade.</div>

                    <div class="title">Royal Bengal Tiger</div>
                    <div class="description">The Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is a magnificent and
                        powerful big cat native to the Indian subcontinent, mainly found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal,
                        and Bhutan. It is the most populous tiger subspecies and is easily recognized by its striking
                        orange coat with bold black stripes and a white underbelly. Adult males can weigh up to 500
                        pounds and are known for their strength, agility, and stealth. Bengal tigers are solitary and
                        territorial animals, primarily hunting at night. Their diet consists mainly of deer, wild boar,
                        and other large herbivores.

                        As apex predators, Bengal tigers play a vital role in maintaining the health and balance of
                        forest ecosystems by regulating prey populations. They inhabit a range of environments, from
                        mangrove swamps and grasslands to tropical forests. Despite their iconic status, they face
                        serious threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. The species is
                        currently listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for their survival.
